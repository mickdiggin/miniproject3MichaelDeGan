# Mini Project 3
## Description

This project utilizes Python and Flask to build and manage a database of movies that can be accessed freely by anyone,
and modified by any registered user.

## Getting Started

### Install requirements with PIP

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Setup your local environment
Download the project source files into a directory of your choice, select it as the current working directory and 
enter the following command:
```
flask --app flaskr init-db
```
### Executing the app

As this application has not yet been deployed into a production environment, you must run it locally on a
development server:
```
flask --app flaskr run
```
The app can then be accessed from a web browser of your choice at the following address: http://127.0.0.1:5000

## Help
If you experience any errors getting your dev server up and running, Flask has 
[excellent troubleshooting documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/server/).
